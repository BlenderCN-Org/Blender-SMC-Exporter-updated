# Blender SMC Exporter updated
This is the repository for the updated versions of the SMC addon for Blender 2.79 and 2.81, although it was "ported" to the new versions by me ([@SalatielSauer](https://salatielsauer.github.io/)), the author of the addon is Eric Depta, more info: http://wrack.github.io/sauerbraten/marchingcubes.html

Version 2.79b solves the error “ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)”
